In this Registration page and login page I have html,css,javascript and bootstrap for the frontend and Nodejs,Express Js and Mongodb for the backened.
Once user reached the registration page he register himself with the help of email id, and his all the data store it in our database with the help of mongodb.
if password and cpassword both are not mached he will get error, another hands when he again try to register using the same email id he will directly redirect to login page there 
he should enter that email id and passowrd so he can login there.
